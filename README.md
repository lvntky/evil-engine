![Evil Engine Logo](docs/misc/evil-engine-logo.png)


Evil Engine is a **retro-inspired game engine** built in C++, designed for crafting 2.5D environments reminiscent of classic titles powered by the Build Engine. The engine leverages **direct framebuffer access** for raw, low-level rendering performance on Linux systems.

## Features

- **Software Rasterizer**: Fully implemented from scratch, capable of rendering:
  - Lines and polygons
  - Textured triangles
  - Depth-buffered scenes
- **Direct Framebuffer Access**: Bypasses windowing systems for ultra-low latency rendering.
- **2.5D Graphics**: Sector-based level design with room-over-room support.
- **Custom Level Editor**: (Planned) Design maps with an intuitive GUI tool.
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard and mouse support for interactive gameplay.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Built to run with only the Linux framebuffer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run Evil Engine, ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:

- **C++ Compiler**: GCC/Clang (Linux)
- **Framebuffer Access**: Ensure `/dev/fb0` is available and accessible. You may need to run as root or configure permissions:
  ```bash
  sudo chmod a+rw /dev/fb0
  ```
- **Make** or a compatible build system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lvntky/evil-engine.git
   cd evil-engine
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Run the engine:
   ```bash
   sudo ./evil-engine
   ```

   **Note**: Root privileges may be required to access the framebuffer device.

### Running in Debug Mode

Enable debugging by building with the `DEBUG` flag:
```bash
make DEBUG=1
```

This will output detailed logs for frame rendering, input handling, and more.

## Usage

- Start the engine:
  ```bash
  sudo ./evil-engine
  ```
- For custom maps, place `.lvl` files in the `maps/` directory and load them at runtime:
  ```bash
  sudo ./evil-engine maps/my-map.lvl
  ```

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Renderer**: Implements a software rasterizer for 2.5D scenes with direct framebuffer access.
- **Input**: Processes keyboard and mouse input using raw input APIs.
- **Physics**: (Planned) Simple 2D collision detection and response.
- **Editor**: (Planned) Integrated map editor for creating and testing levels.
